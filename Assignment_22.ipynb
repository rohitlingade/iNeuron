    "\n",
    "In soft voting, every individual classifier provides a probability value that a specific data point belongs to a particular target class. The predictions are weighted by the classifier's importance and summed up. Then the target label with the greatest sum of weighted probabilities wins the vote."

This is done by building a model from the training data, then creating a second model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model.
